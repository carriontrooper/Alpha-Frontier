Bonjour, Camille Jourdain, head of Thespiaux Medianet! Rising from a small news outlet into a major media player in old Earth's Europe, your network has entertained, informed and shaped opinions of millions around the world and beyond. Your cameras had captured the pandemics of Asia, the worsening climate change, the Jovian unrest, and as a last broadcast on old Earth: the launch of your own colony ship. Packed with the most creative minds from around the world, you seek to document and air the entirety of your colony-building efforts. =

Camille, your people is brimming with creative potential, waiting to be unleashed upon the blank canvas that is this new world. Will you become a new beacon of culture? Can you build a colony that stands the test of time? =

Greetings to you and your beasts, king Smetre D'Poloty of the Xenoidid Empire! As a bioengineering scientist back on old Earth, you've joined the numerous legions of refugees that escaped the collapse. Your ship is among the first to land on this exoplanet - albeit damaged and lacking supplies. It was fortunate, then, that a rare strain of mutated Xeno lifeform lives nearby - one whose hive mind was severed from the main planetary hive mind, and is more open for domestication. That is how you and your people survived, by forming a rudimentary symbiosis with these orphaned Xenos. =

Ever since the collapse ocurred, you've established yourself as a warlord, amassing military might to protect your people. Then, you sought to civilize the devastated states around you, and went on a ten-year campaign to unite most of old Earth's Balkans, South and East Europe under your banner. For a while, your empire porspers, a beacon of martial civility among the ruins. When the climate began to take a turn for the worse, you've managed to build a magnificent colony ship, ready for an exodus to preserve humanity across the stars. =

However, the original intent still lives on, and eventually the Ministry had managed to create a colony ship of their own. Now, the Ministry has found a foothold in this new world, ready to finally fulfill their original purpose. =

Bonjou, Captain Omnira Pessoa of the Free Waverunners! Starting as a small artistic commune in the Caribbeans of old Earth, the societal collapse had turned your collection of artists and writers into a den of pirates just to survive. Over time, your crew had assimilated the other pirates in the area, and grew into a major threat for shipping in the Atlantic. But you kept your artistic roots alive - and even influenced the other pirate groups. It was when you found a failed prototype of a colony ship in a Floridan warehouse that you decided to expand your operations towards other planets. Fixing the ship took time, effort, and a few more raids inland, but at the end it was worth it - soon you'll sail in another ocean, on alien seas unfettered. =

You take their legacy in stride, keeping your company afloat even in the face of the collapse, and the subsequent climate catastrophe. But your engineers haven't been idle - they've successfully created and marketed the designs for a spaceship, a colony ship that could take people to new worlds. So it is no surprise when you took one of your own colony ships into the furthest skies, along with the engineers and families wealthy enough to afford a ticket. =

Greetings to you, Alphone Gunther-Zetkin, CEO of Jaeger Engineering. Since before the collapse of old Earth, your company have long focused on making armored cars. Soon, you've expanded into the weapons manufacturing business, making armored cars and tanks to other countries. It was your company that first developed the Mech as we know it - and you, too, capitalized it, franchising its designs across the globe. When the collapse happened, you've managed to survive by arming everyone and yourself at a profit. Now, that same profit has been invested into a colony ship, where you hope to test your company against other nations among the stars. To you, competition is the ultimate crucible, and you will look for it even in the stars. = こんにちは、ジャガーエンジニアリング社CEO、アルフォンス・ガンサー・ゼットキン様。旧世界の崩壊の前から、我が社は装甲車の製造を手がけてきました。まもなくして武器の製造に手を広げ、他国向けに装甲車や戦車を造るようになりました。今日誰もが知るMechを最初に開発したのはあなたであり、投資して世界中にフランチャイズ展開したのもあなたです。旧世界の崩壊の際には、自身と人々を有料で武装することで生き延びました。その利益は今、我が社の力が他の恒星間国家に通用することを示すための植民船に投資されました。あなたにとって競争は究極の試練であり、あなたは星々の舞台においてさえ競争を求めることでしょう。
