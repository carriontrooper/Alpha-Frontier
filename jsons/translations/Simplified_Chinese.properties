Bonjou, Captain Omnira Pessoa of the Free Waverunners! Starting as a small artistic commune in the Caribbeans of old Earth, the societal collapse had turned your collection of artists and writers into a den of pirates just to survive. Over time, your crew had assimilated the other pirates in the area, and grew into a major threat for shipping in the Atlantic. But you kept your artistic roots alive - and even influenced the other pirate groups. It was when you found a failed prototype of a colony ship in a Floridan warehouse that you decided to expand your operations towards other planets. Fixing the ship took time, effort, and a few more raids inland, but at the end it was worth it - soon you'll sail in another ocean, on alien seas unfettered. =

But your engineers haven't been idle - they've successfully created and marketed the designs for a spaceship, a colony ship that could take people to new worlds.
