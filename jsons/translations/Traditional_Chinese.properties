As a bioengineering scientist back on old Earth, you've joined the numerous legions of refugees that escaped the collapse. Your ship is among the first to land on this exoplanet - albeit damaged and lacking supplies. It was fortunate, then, that a rare strain of mutated Xeno lifeform lives nearby - one whose hive mind was severed from the main planetary hive mind, and is more open for domestication. That is how you and your people survived, by forming a rudimentary symbiosis with these orphaned Xenos. =

When the climate began to take a turn for the worse, you've managed to build a magnificent colony ship, ready for an exodus to preserve humanity across the stars. =

Bonjou, Captain Omnira Pessoa of the Free Waverunners! Starting as a small artistic commune in the Caribbeans of old Earth, the societal collapse had turned your collection of artists and writers into a den of pirates just to survive. Over time, your crew had assimilated the other pirates in the area, and grew into a major threat for shipping in the Atlantic. But you kept your artistic roots alive - and even influenced the other pirate groups. It was when you found a failed prototype of a colony ship in a Floridan warehouse that you decided to expand your operations towards other planets. Fixing the ship took time, effort, and a few more raids inland, but at the end it was worth it - soon you'll sail in another ocean, on alien seas unfettered. =

Your father then expanded the company from an airplane design bureau into the commercial flight business, and you furthered it by investing into the aerospace sector. You take their legacy in stride, keeping your company afloat even in the face of the collapse, and the subsequent climate catastrophe. But your engineers haven't been idle - they've successfully created and marketed the designs for a spaceship, a colony ship that could take people to new worlds. So it is no surprise when you took one of your own colony ships into the furthest skies, along with the engineers and families wealthy enough to afford a ticket. =

When the collapse happened, you've managed to survive by arming everyone and yourself at a profit.

To you, competition is the ultimate crucible, and you will look for it even in the stars. =
