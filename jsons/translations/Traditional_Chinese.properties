Xu Jianhong = 
Ni Hao, Xu Jianhong of Xingxing Fazhan Bu - the Ministry of Planetary Development. Your ministry arose in the East Asia region of old Earth, anticipating an early rush for space colonization - alas, the global collapse had complicated things. Instead, your ministry had turned into one dedicated for the development and defense of the people, focusing on the protection of civilians in the increasingly chaotic times. However, the original intent still lives on, and eventually the Ministry had managed to create a colony ship of their own. Now, the Ministry has found a foothold in this new world, ready to finally fulfill their original purpose. = 
Administrator Xu, your colonists desire to grow and develop this new world. Will you build and protect cities that rival old Earth's magnificence?

Omnira Pessoa = 
Bonjou, Captain Omnira Pessoa of the Free Waverunners! Starting as a small artistic commune in the Caribbeans of old Earth, the societal collapse had turned your collection of artists and writers into a den of pirates just to survive. Over time, your crew had assimilated the other pirates in the area, and grew into a major threat for shipping in the Atlantic. But you kept your artistic roots alive - and even influenced the other pirate groups. It was when you found a failed prototype of a colony ship in a Floridan warehouse that you decided to expand your operations towards other planets. Fixing the ship took time, effort, and a few more raids inland, but at the end it was worth it - soon you'll sail in another ocean, on alien seas unfettered. = 
Captain Omnira, your crew long for the sea once more. Will you spread your artistic roots once more in this new world? Can you build a colony that stands the test of time? =

Harvey Hawkes = 
Howdy, Harvey Hawkes, CEO of Blue Streak Aerodynamics! Coming from a long line of aviators, your grandfather created Blue Streak Aerodynamics before the collapse. Your father then expanded the company from an airplane design bureau into the commercial flight business, and you furthered it by investing into the aerospace sector. You take their legacy in stride, keeping your company afloat even in the face of the collapse, and the subsequent climate catastrophe. But your engineers haven't been idle - they've successfully created and marketed the designs for a spaceship, a colony ship that could take people to new worlds. So it is no surprise when you took one of your own colony ships into the furthest skies, along with the engineers and families wealthy enough to afford a ticket. = 
Harvey, your colonists dream of flying the skies on this new world. Will you reach once more into the sky? Can you build a colony that stands the test of time? =

Greetings to you, Alphone Gunther-Zetkin, CEO of Jaeger Engineering. Since before the collapse of old Earth, your company have long focused on making armored cars. Soon, you've expanded into the weapons manufacturing business, making armored cars and tanks to other countries. It was your company that first developed the Mech as we know it - and you, too, capitalized it, franchising its designs across the globe. When the collapse happened, you've managed to survive by arming everyone and yourself at a profit. Now, that same profit has been invested into a colony ship, where you hope to test your company against other nations among the stars. To you, competition is the ultimate crucible, and you will look for it even in the stars. =
