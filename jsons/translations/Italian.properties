### - General Changes to make - ###
# The following list are items that the mod changes it's name trough all the translations. Have them always in mind!
# When you see "Read as:", means that you have to translate THAT, instead of the line under
# Example: Read as: No Crash Sites
#          No Ancient Ruins = No Crash Sites ( <- in your language)
# NOT:     Read as: No Crash Sites
#          No Ancient Ruins = No Ancient Ruins ( <- in your language)

#  --  When the template is updated, **the updating of the other languages must be done by the translator**
#           We won't add the new lines in the other files, so keep an eye on the updates to this template, and copy-paste the changes.

Connecting your cities to the capital by roads\n  will generate gold via the trade route.\nNote that each road costs 1 gold Maintenance per turn, and each Railroad costs 2 gold,\n  so it may be more economical to wait until the cities grow! =

Then, you sought to civilize the devastated states around you, and went on a ten-year campaign to unite most of old Earth's Balkans, South and East Europe under your banner. For a while, your empire porspers, a beacon of martial civility among the ruins. When the climate began to take a turn for the worse, you've managed to build a magnificent colony ship, ready for an exodus to preserve humanity across the stars. =

However, the original intent still lives on, and eventually the Ministry had managed to create a colony ship of their own. Now, the Ministry has found a foothold in this new world, ready to finally fulfill their original purpose. =

Bonjou, Captain Omnira Pessoa of the Free Waverunners! Starting as a small artistic commune in the Caribbeans of old Earth, the societal collapse had turned your collection of artists and writers into a den of pirates just to survive. Over time, your crew had assimilated the other pirates in the area, and grew into a major threat for shipping in the Atlantic. But you kept your artistic roots alive - and even influenced the other pirate groups. It was when you found a failed prototype of a colony ship in a Floridan warehouse that you decided to expand your operations towards other planets. Fixing the ship took time, effort, and a few more raids inland, but at the end it was worth it - soon you'll sail in another ocean, on alien seas unfettered. =

You take their legacy in stride, keeping your company afloat even in the face of the collapse, and the subsequent climate catastrophe. But your engineers haven't been idle - they've successfully created and marketed the designs for a spaceship, a colony ship that could take people to new worlds. So it is no surprise when you took one of your own colony ships into the furthest skies, along with the engineers and families wealthy enough to afford a ticket. =

Greetings to you, Alphone Gunther-Zetkin, CEO of Jaeger Engineering. Since before the collapse of old Earth, your company have long focused on making armored cars. Soon, you've expanded into the weapons manufacturing business, making armored cars and tanks to other countries. It was your company that first developed the Mech as we know it - and you, too, capitalized it, franchising its designs across the globe. When the collapse happened, you've managed to survive by arming everyone and yourself at a profit. Now, that same profit has been invested into a colony ship, where you hope to test your company against other nations among the stars. To you, competition is the ultimate crucible, and you will look for it even in the stars. =
